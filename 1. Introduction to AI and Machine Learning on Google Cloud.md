## Three layers of the AI/ML framework on Google Cloud
- AI Foundations: Cloud essentials and data tools
- AI Developments: Predictive AI and generative AI
- AI Solutions: Vertical solutions and horizontal solutions


## AI FOUNDATIONS
### Storage
- Standard: frequently accessed, hot data
- Nearline: at most once per 30 days
- Coldline: at most once per 90 days
- Archive : at most once per year (365 days)


### BigQuery ML steps
1. Extract, transform and  load data into BigQuery
2. Select and preprocess features
3. Create the model inside BigQuery
4. Evaluate the performance of the trained model
5. Use the model to make predictions


## AI DEVELOPMENTS
### 4 options to build machine learning model
- Pre-trained APIs: have little ML expertise or no intention to train a model
- BigQuery ML     : familar with SQL and have data in BigQuery
- Auto ML         : build custom model with own training data with minimal coding, Vertex AI: auto ML (2018) is embedded into Vertex AI platform (2021)
- Custom training : want full control of ML workflow


## AI DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
- confusion matrix, precision, recall

- activation function:
    + sigmoid: binary classification
    + softmax: multi-class classification

-  Vertex AI offers two options on one platform to build a ML model: a codeless solution with AutoML and a code-based solution with Custom Training using Vertex Workbench
