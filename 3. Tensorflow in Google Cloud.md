# Introduction
- Model is represented in DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
- Can be executed in both CPU, GPU, TPU
- Hierarchy:
    + high level API for distributed training: tf.estimator, tf.keras, tf.data
    + components useful when build custom NN model: tf.losses, tf.optimizers, tf.metrics, ...

- Number of embedding dimension?
    + lower dimensions: less accuracy, more lossy compression
    + higher dimesions: overfitting, slow training

# Design and Build an Input Data Pipeline
- Keras preprocessing layers:
    + Text preprocessing: tf.keras.layers.TextVectorization() turns string to encoded representation
    + Numerical features preprocessing: tf.keras.layers.Normalization(), tf.keras.layers.Discretization()
    + Categorical features preprocessing: CategoryEncoding, Hashing, StringLookup, IntegerLookup
    + Image preprocessing:
    + Image data augmentation:

- NOTE: TextVectorization, StringLookup and IntegerLookup,Normalization, Discretization: are non-trainable, Their state is not set during training.
